# KNIMEÂ® Python Type - Extension Points

This repository is maintained by the [KNIME Team Rakete](mailto:team-rakete@knime.com).

This repository contains the extension points which allow adding new data types and 
port objects to Python in a way that they can be communicated back and forth between
Python and Java.

See the repository [knime-python-types-example](https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-python-types-example) for an example.
